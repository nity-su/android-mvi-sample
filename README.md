# android-mvi-sample
Example MVI implementation, based off of Google's architectural samples.

## Description

This is a sample implementation of the Model View Intent pattern. Full Android examples for MVI are hard to find.

Target audience include, but not limited to:

- Developers making the pivot from an imperative to declarative style of programming.
- Developers looking for working example of functional or reactive programming on Android.

Here are some articles/examples explaining the core principles of MVI and unidirectional flow:

## Key Application Components

- **[ModelStore.kt](https://github.com/kanawish/android-mvi-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/kanawish/sample/mvi/model/ModelStore.kt)**: a generic Model Store inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- **[Intent.kt](https://github.com/kanawish/android-mvi-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/kanawish/sample/mvi/intent/Intent.kt)**: basic DSL for building Intents and Reducers for generic types.
- **[TaskEditorState.kt](https://github.com/kanawish/android-mvi-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/kanawish/sample/mvi/model/TaskEditorState.kt)**: sealed class + reducer based state machine.

## Stack

One goal of this repo is to keep things as light as possible. The core libraries used are:

- Kotlin
- RxJava 2
- RxBindings
- RxRelay
- Retrofit
- Toothpick DI

If you require a very lightweight project, and still want to do MVI, it's not unreasonable to think you could do without RxJava. As of writing, RxJava dependencies weighs in at about ~2MB.

Once you grasp the basics, I suggest you explore the following existing libraries:

- https://github.com/airbnb/MvRx
- https://github.com/badoo/MVICore
- https://github.com/freeletics/RxRedux
- https://github.com/groupon/grox
- https://github.com/spotify/mobius
- https://github.com/Tinder/StateMachine


model has state that is changed by the UI react

Intent represents an intention or a desire to perform an action

In example, view folder has the events class (click,edit..) **[AddEditTaskViewEvent.kt](https://github.com/nity-su/android-mvi-sample/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/kanawish/sample/mvi/view/addedittask/AddEditTaskViewEvent.kt)**
